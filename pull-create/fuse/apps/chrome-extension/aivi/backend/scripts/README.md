# Database Scripts

## Upgrade User to Pro Tier

To upgrade bizsynth@gmail.com to pro tier, run:

```bash
cd backend
node scripts/upgrade-user.js
```

**Note**: This requires a valid database connection. Make sure your `.env` file
has the correct `DATABASE_URL`.

### Production Deployment

If running on Railway or another hosted environment:

```bash
# SSH into production or use Railway CLI
railway run node scripts/upgrade-user.js
```

### Manual SQL (Alternative)

If you prefer to run SQL directly, use the migration file:

```bash
psql $DATABASE_URL < migrations/update-bizsynth-to-pro.sql
```

Or copy the SQL and run it in your database GUI:

```sql
UPDATE users
SET tier = 'pro', daily_limit = 999999, updated_at = NOW()
WHERE email = 'bizsynth@gmail.com';
```

### Verify the Upgrade

After running, the user should have:

- **Tier**: pro
- **Daily Limit**: 999999 (unlimited)
- **Features**: All pro features unlocked
