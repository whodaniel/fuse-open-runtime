## 🚀 DEPLOY NOW (Railway Dashboard Method)

I've opened your Railway dashboard in Chrome:
**https://railway.app/project/041cee9d-8648-4074-b5a6-0eae436de1d1**

### Step 1: Connect GitHub Repo (if not already connected)
1. In the Railway dashboard, click **"+ New"**
2. Select **"GitHub Repo"**
3. Choose **"whodaniel/fuse"**
4. Select branch: **main**

### Step 2: Configure Build Settings
Railway should auto-detect, but verify:
- **Root Directory**: `apps/frontend`
- **Build Command**: `pnpm install && pnpm run build`
- **Start Command**: `pnpm run preview` (or use static hosting)

OR for static hosting:
- **Root Directory**: `apps/frontend`
- **Build Command**: `pnpm install && pnpm run build`
- **Output Directory**: `dist`
- Enable **"Static Site"** option

### Step 3: Set Environment Variables
In Railway dashboard → your service → **Variables** tab:
```
NODE_ENV=production
VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend.railway.app
VITE_WS_URL=wss://your-backend.railway.app
```

If you don't have a backend yet, use placeholders:
```
NODE_ENV=production
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://placeholder.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=placeholder
```

### Step 4: Deploy!
1. Click **"Deploy"**
2. Watch the build logs
3. Get your Railway URL (will be like: `your-app.up.railway.app`)

### Step 5: Add Custom Domain (www.thenewfuse.com)
1. Go to **Settings** → **Domains**
2. Click **"+ Custom Domain"**
3. Enter: `www.thenewfuse.com`
4. Railway will show you the CNAME record to add

## 🔧 DNS SETUP (For www.thenewfuse.com)

After adding custom domain in Railway, add this CNAME record at your domain registrar:

```
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: [Railway will provide this]
TTL: 3600
```

Railway provides the exact value when you add the custom domain.

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

**Build fails?**
- Check build logs in Railway dashboard
- Verify pnpm version compatibility
- Check that all dependencies are in package.json

**Domain not working?**
- DNS takes 5-60 minutes to propagate
- Verify CNAME record is correct
- Check Railway domain status

**App shows errors?**
- Set environment variables
- Check that VITE_ variables are set
- Redeploy after adding variables

**Status**: Railway project linked and ready
**Next**: Deploy from Railway dashboard (already open in your browser)
**Time**: 2-3 minutes to deploy
