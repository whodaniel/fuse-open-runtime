# Security Cleanup Summary

**Date:** 2025-11-17 **Action:** Removed hardcoded secrets and migrated to
environment variables

---

## What Was Done

### 1. Secrets Extracted and Backed Up ✅

All hardcoded secrets have been extracted and saved to:

```
/Users/danielgoldberg/SECRETS-BACKUP.txt
```

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** This file contains sensitive credentials including:

- Stripe LIVE API key
- Google Firebase API keys
- Google Cloud Service Account credentials

**Actions Required:**

1. Review the backup file
2. Transfer credentials to a secure password manager (1Password, LastPass, etc.)
3. **Delete the backup file** after secure storage: `rm ~/SECRETS-BACKUP.txt`

---

### 2. Code Updated to Use Environment Variables ✅

#### Files Modified:

**`apps/frontend/src/pages/Settings.tsx`**

- **Before:** Hardcoded Stripe API key
- **After:** Uses `import.meta.env.VITE_STRIPE_API_KEY`
- **Line:** 246

**`apps/frontend/src/lib/firebase.ts`**

- **Before:** Hardcoded Firebase config with fallback values
- **After:** Uses environment variables only, with validation
- **Lines:** 7-19
- **New:** Added configuration validation to warn if env vars are missing

**`apps/frontend/scripts/set-env.sh`**

- **Before:** Hardcoded Firebase credentials in script
- **After:** Reads from environment variables
- **New:** Added warnings to ensure env vars are set before execution

---

### 3. Git Tracking Cleaned Up ✅

**Removed from Git Tracking** (files still exist locally):

- `.env.a2a`
- `.env.development`
- `.env.docker`
- `.env.mcp`
- `.env.production`
- `apps/frontend/.env.production`

**Deleted Completely:**

- `tools/legacy-files/firebase-credentials.json` (contained Google service
  account private keys)

---

### 4. .gitignore Updated ✅

Enhanced the `.gitignore` to ensure:

- All `.env*` files are ignored (except `.env.example` and `.env*.example`)
- Service account JSON files are blocked
- Firebase credentials files are blocked
- Your local `SECRETS-BACKUP.txt` is ignored

---

## Required Environment Variables

Create a local `.env` file in your project root with these variables:

### Frontend Environment Variables

```bash
# Stripe
VITE_STRIPE_API_KEY=REDACTED-STRIPE-KEY

# Firebase
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=REDACTED-FIREBASE-KEY-1
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=the-new-fuse-2025.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=the-new-fuse-2025
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=the-new-fuse-2025.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=1003514421915
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:1003514421915:web:9f5b9f9f9f9f9f9f9f9f9f
```

### Backend Environment Variables

```bash
# Google Cloud Service Account (for backend)
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL=REDACTED-SERVICE-ACCOUNT-1@example.com
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----"
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=the-new-fuse-2025
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=REDACTED-SERVICE-ACCOUNT-1@example.com
```

**Note:** The full private key is in `/Users/danielgoldberg/SECRETS-BACKUP.txt`

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Before Making Repo Public)

- [ ] **1. Set Up Local Environment**

  ```bash
  cd /Users/danielgoldberg/fuse-repo
  cp .env.example .env
  # Edit .env and add your secrets from SECRETS-BACKUP.txt
  ```

- [ ] **2. Configure Production Environment**

  **For Railway:**

  ```bash
  # Navigate to Railway dashboard
  # Go to your project → Variables
  # Add all environment variables from the list above
  ```

  **For Other Hosts (Vercel, Netlify, etc.):**
  - Add environment variables in the hosting platform's dashboard
  - Ensure all `VITE_*` variables are prefixed correctly for Vite to expose them

- [ ] **3. Test Your Application**

  ```bash
  # Start development server
  pnpm run dev

  # Check browser console for any Firebase config errors
  # Test Stripe functionality
  ```

- [ ] **4. Commit These Changes**

  ```bash
  git status
  git add .
  git commit -m "Security: Remove hardcoded secrets and migrate to environment variables

  - Removed hardcoded API keys from Settings.tsx, firebase.ts, and set-env.sh
  - Updated code to use environment variables
  - Removed .env files from git tracking
  - Deleted firebase-credentials.json containing service account keys
  - Enhanced .gitignore to prevent future secret commits

  🔒 All secrets now require environment configuration"
  ```

- [ ] **5. Secure Cleanup**
  ```bash
  # After transferring to password manager:
  rm ~/SECRETS-BACKUP.txt
  ```

### Security Best Practices

#### Before Making Repo Public

**CONSIDER ROTATING THESE CREDENTIALS:**

Since the repo was private and these secrets were only visible to you, rotation
is optional but recommended:

1. **Stripe API Key** (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
   - This is a LIVE key with real payment access
   - Rotate via: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
   - Click the "..." menu on the key → Roll key
   - Update in all environments after rotation

2. **Firebase API Keys**
   - Less critical (these are meant to be public-ish)
   - Still good practice to rotate
   - Rotate via:
     https://console.firebase.google.com/project/the-new-fuse-2025/settings/general

3. **Google Service Account**
   - Rotate via:
     https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts?project=the-new-fuse-2025
   - Delete old service account
   - Create new one
   - Download new JSON credentials
   - Update environment variables

#### GitHub Secrets (for CI/CD)

If you use GitHub Actions, add secrets at:

```
https://github.com/whodaniel/fuse/settings/secrets/actions
```

**Required Secrets for CI/CD:**

- `VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY`
- `VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`
- `VITE_STRIPE_API_KEY` (if testing payments in CI)

## Verification Checklist

Before pushing to public repo:

- [ ] All hardcoded secrets removed from code
- [ ] `.env` files are git-ignored
- [ ] Local `.env` file created with secrets
- [ ] Production environment variables configured
- [ ] Application tested and working
- [ ] `SECRETS-BACKUP.txt` deleted
- [ ] (Optional but recommended) All credentials rotated
- [ ] Committed changes with proper commit message
- [ ] **RUN:** `git log --all -- '*.env*' 'firebase-credentials.json'` to verify
      files removed from history

---

## Git History Cleanup (Advanced)

**⚠️ WARNING:** These secrets are still in your git history. If you want to
completely remove them before making the repo public, you have two options:

### Option 1: BFG Repo-Cleaner (Recommended)

```bash
# Install BFG
brew install bfg  # macOS
# or download from: https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/

# Create a file with secrets to remove
cat > secrets.txt << 'EOF'
REDACTED-STRIPE-KEY
REDACTED-FIREBASE-KEY-1
REDACTED-KEY-ID-1
EOF

# Run BFG to replace secrets in history
bfg --replace-text secrets.txt

# Clean up
git reflog expire --expire=now --all && git gc --prune=now --aggressive

# Force push (WARNING: This rewrites history!)
# git push --force
```

### Option 2: Start Fresh (Nuclear Option)

If the repo doesn't have important history:

```bash
# Create new repo without history
rm -rf .git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit (cleaned)"
git remote add origin https://github.com/whodaniel/fuse.git
git push -f origin main
```

### Option 3: Keep History (Easiest)

If rotating all credentials, you can safely make the repo public without
cleaning history:

1. Rotate ALL credentials listed above
2. Old secrets in history become useless
3. Make repo public

## Support

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check that all environment variables are set correctly
2. Verify `.env` file is in the project root
3. Restart your development server
4. Check browser console for configuration errors

**Environment Variable Debugging:**

```bash
# Check if variables are loaded (development)
echo $VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY

# In your code, temporarily log (remove after debugging):
console.log('Firebase API Key exists:', !!import.meta.env.VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY)
```

---

**Remember:** Never commit secrets to git. Always use environment variables for
sensitive data!
