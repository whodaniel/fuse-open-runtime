# Railway Deployment Checklist

## ✅ Already Completed

- [x] Railway CLI installed
- [x] Logged into Railway
- [x] Project created: `the-new-fuse`
- [x] Project URL: https://railway.com/project/453fe77c-a788-412d-8507-bc3e7bc548c3
- [x] Dockerfiles created for all services
- [x] Railway configuration files updated

## 🔄 Complete These Steps

### Step 1: Add PostgreSQL Database

**Option A - Dashboard (Easiest):**
1. Open: https://railway.com/project/453fe77c-a788-412d-8507-bc3e7bc548c3
2. Click "+ New"
3. Select "Database" → "PostgreSQL"
4. Wait ~30 seconds for provisioning

**Option B - CLI:**
```bash
railway add
# Select: Database → PostgreSQL
```

- [ ] PostgreSQL database added and running

### Step 2: Deploy API Service

```bash
cd /Users/danielgoldberg/Desktop/A1-Inter-LLM-Com/The-New-Fuse/apps/api
railway up
```

**What happens:**
- Code uploads to Railway
- Docker image builds (10-15 min first time)
- Service deploys automatically
- You get a deployment URL

- [ ] API service deployed successfully
- [ ] API URL: ___________________________________

### Step 3: Deploy Frontend Service

```bash
cd /Users/danielgoldberg/Desktop/A1-Inter-LLM-Com/The-New-Fuse/apps/frontend
railway up
```

**What happens:**
- Frontend code uploads
- Docker build (5-10 min)
- Service deploys
- You get a frontend URL

- [ ] Frontend deployed successfully
- [ ] Frontend URL: ___________________________________

### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

**For API Service:**

Go to: Railway Dashboard → API Service → Variables

Add these variables:
```
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3001
DATABASE_URL=${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}
JWT_SECRET=<paste generated secret below>
```

Generate JWT Secret:
```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```
Your JWT Secret: ___________________________________

- [ ] API environment variables configured

**For Frontend Service:**

Go to: Railway Dashboard → Frontend Service → Variables

Add these variables:
```
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000
VITE_API_URL=<paste your API URL here>
```

- [ ] Frontend environment variables configured

### Step 5: Verify Deployment

```bash
# Check status
railway status

# View logs
railway logs --service api
railway logs --service frontend

# Open dashboard
railway open
```

- [ ] Both services showing as "Active"
- [ ] No errors in logs
- [ ] Frontend accessible via browser
- [ ] Frontend can connect to API

## 🎯 Quick Commands Reference

```bash
# View all services
railway status

# View API logs
railway logs --service api

# View Frontend logs
railway logs --service frontend

# Open Railway Dashboard
railway open

# Redeploy a service
cd apps/api && railway up --detach

# Check Railway whoami
railway whoami
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Build fails with dependency errors
- Check logs: `railway logs --service <name>`
- Dockerfiles use `--ignore-scripts` to skip native modules
- Should build successfully in Railway's environment

### Service won't start
- Verify environment variables are set
- Check DATABASE_URL format
- Review startup logs for errors

### Frontend can't reach API
- Verify VITE_API_URL is set correctly
- Check API service is deployed and running
- Verify API has public domain configured

### Database connection fails
- Ensure PostgreSQL is added and running
- Verify DATABASE_URL uses Railway template: `${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}`
- Check API service logs for connection errors

## 📊 Expected Timeline

| Task | Time |
|------|------|
| Add PostgreSQL | 30 seconds |
| API Build & Deploy | 10-15 minutes |
| Frontend Build & Deploy | 5-10 minutes |
| Configure Variables | 5 minutes |
| **Total** | **~20-30 minutes** |

## 💰 Cost Estimate

**Free Tier:**
- 500 execution hours/month
- Good for testing

**Hobby Plan ($5/month):**
- Unlimited execution hours
- Recommended for continuous operation

**Your Usage:**
- API: ~512MB RAM
- Frontend: ~256MB RAM
- PostgreSQL: ~256MB RAM
- **Total: ~1GB RAM** ✅ Fits in Hobby plan

## ✅ Success Criteria

When deployment is complete, you should have:

- [ ] API service running at a Railway URL
- [ ] Frontend service running at a Railway URL
- [ ] PostgreSQL database connected to API
- [ ] Frontend can load and display UI
- [ ] API responds to health checks
- [ ] No errors in service logs

## 🎉 Post-Deployment

After successful deployment:

1. **Custom Domain** (Optional)
   - Go to Service → Settings → Domains
   - Add your custom domain

2. **Monitoring**
   - Railway provides built-in metrics
   - Check CPU, Memory, and Network usage

3. **CI/CD** (Optional)
   - Connect GitHub repository
   - Enable automatic deployments on push

4. **Scaling** (If needed)
   - Adjust replicas in service settings
   - Configure auto-scaling rules
