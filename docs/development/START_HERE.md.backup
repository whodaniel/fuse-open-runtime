## Quick 3-Step Process

### Step 1: Create Services in Dashboard (5 min)

Visit: https://railway.com/project/041cee9d-8648-4074-b5a6-0eae436de1d1

Create 4 empty services:

### Step 2: Run Deployment Script (60-80 min)

```bash
cd /Users/danielgoldberg/Desktop/A1-Inter-LLM-Com/The-New-Fuse
./deploy-to-services.sh
```

### Step 3: Configure Variables (10 min)

While builds run, add environment variables in Railway dashboard.
