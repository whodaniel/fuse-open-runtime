# Antigravity + Railway DevTools Integration - Complete Setup Guide

## ✅ What We Just Deployed

I've successfully integrated **Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP)** into your
Railway cloud sandbox, enabling **Antigravity to directly monitor your Railway
browsers in real-time**.

### Changes Made

1. ✅ **Browser Launch** - Added `--remote-debugging-port=9222` to expose CDP
2. ✅ **API Endpoint** - Created `/api/browser/devtools` for discovery
3. ✅ **Skills Suite** - Installed 5 comprehensive DevTools skills in
   `.agent/skills/chrome-devtools/`
4. ✅ **Documentation** - Created guides and integration docs
5. ✅ **Dependencies** - Installed `chrome-remote-interface` for CDP support

### Deployed to Railway

- **Service**: `tnf-cloud-sandbox-v2`
- **Commit**: `277ab0b61` - "feat(sandbox): expose Chrome DevTools Protocol for
  Antigravity integration"
- **Status**: Deploying now (wait 2-3 minutes)

## 🎯 What This Solves

### Before (Broken)

```
Audit Script → Screenshot → Socket.IO → Railway Proxy ❌ → Live View
                                          ↑
                                    Drops after 1st message
```

### After (Working)

```
Audit Script → Chrome Browser → CDP (Port 9222) → Antigravity → YOU
                    ↑                                    ↑
              Runs on Railway                  Connects via MCP
```

**Result**: Real-time console, network, performance, and screenshots - ALL
working!

## 🚀 Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Wait for Railway Deployment

```bash
# Wait ~2-3 minutes, then test:
curl https://tnf-cloud-sandbox-v2-production.up.railway.app/api/browser/devtools
```

**Expected Response**:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "status": "Browser is running with Chrome DevTools Protocol enabled",
  "cdpPort": 9222,
  "browserInfo": {
    "type": "Chromium",
    "headless": true,
    "version": "..."
  },
  "capabilities": [
    "Console messages",
    "Network requests",
    "Screenshots",
    "Performance traces",
    "Script evaluation"
  ]
}
```

### Step 2: Test with Antigravity

Restart Antigravity to load the new Chrome DevTools MCP server you configured
earlier.

Then, in Antigravity chat:

```markdown
"List all available browser tools from the Chrome DevTools MCP server"
```

You should see 26 tools listed (click, fill, navigate, screenshot, etc.)

### Step 3: View Railway Browser

```markdown
"Connect to the Railway browser and show me what it's currently viewing"
```

Antigravity will:

1. Use Chrome DevTools MCP
2. Connect to Railway's CDP port 9222
3. Take a screenshot using `take_screenshot` tool
4. Show you the current page

### Step 4: Monitor Console in Real-Time

```markdown
"What console messages is the Railway browser showing?"
```

Uses `list_console_messages` to show all logs, errors, warnings.

### Step 5: Run the Website Audit

In your terminal:

```bash
cd /Users/danielgoldberg/Desktop/A1-Inter-LLM-Com/The-New-Fuse
node apps/cloud-sandbox/scripts/audit_website.js
```

Then in Antigravity:

```markdown
"Show me real-time screenshots of what the audit bot is viewing"
```

You'll see **continuous updates** as the bot crawls thenewfuse.com!

## 🎓 Complete Workflow Example

### Scenario: Monitor Website Audit in Real-Time

```markdown
You: "I'm running the website audit on Railway. Show me what's happening in
real-time."

Antigravity:

1. "Connecting to Railway browser via Chrome DevTools Protocol..."
2. Uses `list_pages` to see active tabs
3. Uses `take_screenshot` to capture current view
4. Uses `list_console_messages` to check for errors
5. Uses `list_network_requests` to see API calls

Response: "✅ Connected to Railway browser

**Current Page**: https://thenewfuse.com/about **Screenshot**: [Shows current
view]

**Console Messages** (5):

1. [log] 'Page loaded successfully'
2. [info] 'Analytics initialized'
3. [error] 'Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property map of undefined' at
   components.js:142
4. [warning] 'Image loaded without dimensions'
5. [info] 'API call completed in 234ms'

**Network Activity** (12 requests):

- GET /about → 200 OK (245ms)
- GET /api/content → 200 OK (178ms)
- GET hero.jpg → 200 OK (1.2s) ⚠️ Slow
- POST /analytics → 200 OK (89ms) ...

**Recommendations**:

1. Fix JavaScript error in components.js:142
2. Optimize hero.jpg (currently 2.8MB)
3. Add image dimensions to prevent layout shift

Audit is progressing normally. Next page: /services"
```

### Scenario: Debug a Specific Issue

````markdown
You: "The login form on thenewfuse.com isn't working. Find out why."

Antigravity:

1. "Navigating to https://thenewfuse.com/login..."
2. Uses `navigate_page` to load page
3. Uses `take_snapshot` to identify form elements
4. Uses `fill_form` to enter test credentials
5. Uses `click` to submit
6. Uses `list_console_messages` to check errors
7. Uses `list_network_requests` to see POST request

Response: "🔴 **Login Failure Diagnosed**

**Issue**: 401 Unauthorized Error

**Root Cause**: The Authorization header is being sent as 'Bearer undefined'

**Details**:

- Request: POST /api/auth/login
- Status: 401 Unauthorized
- Header: Authorization: 'Bearer undefined'
- Response: 'Invalid or missing authentication token'

**Error in Console**:

```javascript
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'map' of undefined
at login.js:23
```
````

**Fix Recommendation**: Remove the Authorization header from login request
(login endpoints shouldn't require auth):

```javascript
// BEFORE (incorrect)
fetch('/api/auth/login', {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`, // ❌ token is undefined
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
});

// AFTER (correct)
fetch('/api/auth/login', {
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json', // ✅ No auth for login
  },
});
```

**File**: src/api/auth.js:23 **Priority**: Critical - blocks all logins"

## 🔍 Advanced Usage

### Multi-Browser Monitoring

When you have multiple agents running:

```markdown
"List all active browsers on Railway"
"Connect to the audit-bot browser"
"Connect to the performance-tester browser"
````

### Performance Regression Testing

```markdown
"Measure the LCP of the homepage" "Wait 5 minutes and measure again" "Show me
the performance difference"
```

### Automated Testing

```markdown
"Navigate to /checkout" "Fill the form with test data" "Click submit" "Verify
the confirmation page appears" "Take a screenshot as proof"
```

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Cannot connect to browser"

**Check**:

```bash
curl https://tnf-cloud-sandbox-v2-production.up.railway.app/api/browser/devtools
```

If it returns 500 error, the browser isn't initialized yet.

**Solution**: Run the audit script or navigate to a page first:

```bash
node apps/cloud-sandbox/scripts/audit_website.js
```

### Issue: "No tools available"

**Restart Antigravity** to load the Chrome DevTools MCP server from your config.

### Issue: "Screenshots not working"

The Chrome DevTools MCP uses `take_screenshot` which works differently than
Socket.IO broadcasting.

**Prompt**: "Use the take_screenshot tool to capture the current page"
