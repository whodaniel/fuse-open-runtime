## Privacy + Access Model

- Timeline API endpoints are protected by `JwtAuthGuard`.
- Timeline reads/writes are user-scoped (`userId` enforced server-side).
- Unified ledger records/tasks/suggestions are now owner-scoped in
  controller/service access paths.
- `/timeline` frontend route is protected via `RequireMemberAccess`
  (`RequireAuth` + membership check).
