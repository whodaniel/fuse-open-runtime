[BETA] DEAD CODE AUDIT
Timestamp: 2026-04-05T19:47:00-04:00

## ORPHANED COMPONENTS
- 🔴 Found 48 potentially orphaned page components not explicitly referenced in ComprehensiveRouter.tsx (e.g. `Home.tsx`, `MemoryInspector.tsx`, `TNFCommandCenter.tsx`, `AgentsListPage.tsx`, `AIPortal.tsx`). Further manual pruning is advised based on the canonical sitemap.
- ✅ Removed deprecated navigation components: `nav-menu.tsx` and `MobileNav.tsx`. 
- ✅ Confirmed `Landing.tsx`, `LandingPage.tsx`, and `LandingRedesigned.tsx` were already purged from the frontend codebase.

[BETA] DESIGN SYSTEM COHESION
- 🟡 Discovered 26 files in `/pages` that contain hardcoded hex colors outside the sanctioned design system variables. These should be migrated to CSS custom properties or Tailwind classes.

[BETA] TYPESCRIPT HEALTH
- 🔴 Discovered 428 files containing `@ts-ignore` or `@ts-nocheck` directives. This is a severe violation of strict-mode compliance. A major, phased modernization initiative needs to be tracked.

[BETA] P0 RUTINE VALIDATION (Page Quality)
- 🟡 Routes `/dashboard`, `/agents`, `/workflows`, `/admin`, and `/hub` were reviewed (via existing layout dependencies). 
- ✅ They cleanly map to PremiumLayout.

[BETA] CSS/STYLE AUDIT
- 🟡 Tailwind + shadcn is structurally dominant, but the presence of hardcoded hex values implies some residual Emotion/Styled-Component patterns or inline styles might remain.

[BETA] RECOMMENDATIONS
1. 🔴 Execute batch eradication of orphaned pages, cross-checking `routes.ts` and `sitemap.ts` to ensure no silent imports remain.
2. 🔴 Target `@ts-ignore` instances sequentially, starting with the P0 critical paths to improve type safety.
3. 🟡 Establish an ESLint rule preventing new hardcoded hex colors in `.tsx` files.
